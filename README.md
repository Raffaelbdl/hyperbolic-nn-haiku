# hyperbolic-nn-haiku

This is a work in progress ‚ùó

The goal of this project is to implement various hyperbolic neural networks as well as optimizers, test them and make them available in JAX.

The neural networks will be implemented on Haiku and the optimizers will be based on the optax library.
